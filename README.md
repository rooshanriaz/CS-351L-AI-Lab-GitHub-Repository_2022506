## Lab 1: Number Guessing Game

In the first lab, we implemented and tested the following search algorithms on a number guessing game:
#### BFS

Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It's a complete and optimal search strategy for finite spaces.

#### DFS

Depth-First Search (DFS) explores as far down as possible along a branch before backtracking. It can be more memory-efficient but may not always find the optimal solution in large search spaces.

#### Simulated Annealing

Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic technique that approximates the global optimum of a given function. It is particularly useful in optimization problems with large, complex search spaces.

## Lab 2: 2048 Game

In the second lab, we implemented the A* search algorithm to solve the 2048 game. A* is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic to estimate the cost of reaching the goal, making it both complete and optimal under certain conditions.
