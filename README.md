## Lab 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Python Basics

In this lab, I implemented and tested various search algorithms on a number guessing game:

### BFS

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is a complete and optimal search strategy for finite spaces.

### DFS

**Depth-First Search (DFS)** explores as far down as possible along a branch before backtracking. It is more memory-efficient but may not always find the optimal solution in large search spaces.

### Simulated Annealing

**Simulated Annealing** is a probabilistic technique that approximates the global optimum of a given function. It is especially useful for optimization problems with large, complex search spaces.

## Lab 2: Introduction to Search in AI

In this lab, I implemented the **A* Search Algorithm** to solve the Maze Runner game. A* is an informed search algorithm that uses heuristics to estimate the cost of reaching the goal, making it both complete and optimal under certain conditions.
