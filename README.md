## Lab 1: Number Guessing Game

In the first lab, we implemented and tested the following search algorithms on a number guessing game:
#### BFS
#### DFS
#### Simulated Annealing

## Lab 2: 2048 Game

In the second lab, we implemented the A* search algorithm to solve the 2048 game. A* is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic to estimate the cost of reaching the goal, making it both complete and optimal under certain conditions.
